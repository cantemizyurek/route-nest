## üìñ Usage

To start using Route Nest, you need to import and initialize it within your
project. Here‚Äôs a quick guide on how to set it up with Express:

### Installation

First, install the package and any necessary adapters:

```bash
npm install route-nest @route-nest/express
```

### Basic Setup

Import and initialize Route Nest along with your framework-specific adapter:

```typescript
import { initRouteNestTree } from 'route-nest'
import { initExpress } from '@route-nest/express-adapter'

async function startServer() {
  const app = initExpress(await initRouteNestTree('.'))
  app.listen(3000, () => console.log('Server listening on port 3000'))
}

startServer()
```

This setup assumes you have a directory called `app` at your project root,
containing your route files structured in a way that Route Nest can understand.
